I'm having trouble building the extension

Workspace: Collecting workspace informationFiltering to most relevant informationYour build is failing during the `clean:bundle` step for several packages, with errors related to `pnpm add pnpm@9.15.1` and "The system cannot find the path specified." This is likely due to a misconfiguration or a missing dependency in your environment.

### Key Issues:
- **`pnpm add pnpm@9.15.1`**: Your build is trying to install a specific version of `pnpm` inside sub-packages, which is unusual and often unnecessary.
- **"The system cannot find the path specified."**: This usually means a script or tool (like `rimraf`) is not installed or not found in your `PATH`.

---

## How to Fix

### 1. Ensure `rimraf` is installed
Make sure `rimraf` is installed at the root level:

```sh
pnpm add -D rimraf
```

### 2. Remove Unnecessary `pnpm add pnpm@9.15.1` Steps
Check if any of your package scripts or turbo.json are running `pnpm add pnpm@9.15.1`. This should not be necessary. Remove any such lines.

### 3. Clean and Reinstall Node Modules
Sometimes, a corrupted node_modules or lockfile can cause these issues:

```sh
pnpm clean:node_modules
pnpm install
```

### 4. Check Your PATH
Ensure that your system `PATH` includes the directory where `rimraf` and `pnpm` binaries are installed. On Windows, this is usually handled by `pnpm`, but sometimes manual adjustment is needed.

### 5. Check for Local `pnpm` Executables
If you see references to `pnpm.CMD` or similar, make sure that .bin exists and contains the necessary executables.

---

## Summary

- Install `rimraf` at the root.
- Remove any scripts that install `pnpm` inside sub-packages.
- Clean and reinstall dependencies.
- Ensure your `PATH` is correct.

If you need to see or edit the scripts, check the `scripts` section in each package's package.json, such as package.json, package.json, etc.

If the problem persists, please check for any custom logic in your turbo.json or package scripts that might be invoking `pnpm add pnpm@9.15.1`.

GratitechHD: Perform fix #3 

GitHub Copilot: The clean and reinstall steps completed successfully, but the build still fails with:

Error: Cannot find module '.../node_modules/.pnpm/vite@6.3.5.../node_modules/vite/bin/vite.js'

This means Vite is not being installed in the expected location, or there is a hoisting/workspace configuration issue.

**Next steps:**
1. Try running pnpm install -F chrome-extension to force install Vite and dependencies in the chrome-extension workspace.
2. If that doesn't work, try manually installing Vite in the root: pnpm add -D vite@6.3.5

Would you like me to proceed with these steps?

GratitechHD: Yes proceed

GitHub Copilot: The build for chrome-extension is still failing with:

Error: Cannot find module '...node_modules\.pnpm\vite@6.3.5...node_modules\vite\bin\vite.js'

This means Vite is still not being properly linked or hoisted for the chrome-extension package, even after forcing install and hoisting.

**Next steps:**
1. Manually add vite as a direct devDependency in chrome-extension/package.json.
2. Run pnpm install -F chrome-extension again.

Would you like me to proceed with this fix?

GratitechHD: Yes proceed

The build is now successful for all packages, including chrome-extension. The Vite module issue is resolved by adding vite as a direct devDependency in chrome-extension.

If you have any more issues or need further help, let me know!

GratitechHD: So what was the primary issue that prevented it from building? We've already went through lots of fixes, I want to know for sure the root cause, or root causes.

GitHub Copilot: The primary issue that prevented your project from building was that the chrome-extension package (and possibly others) did **not have `vite` listed as a direct dependency** in its package.json. As a result, the Vite binary was missing from the expected location, causing the build to fail with a "Cannot find module ...vite/bin/vite.js" error.

**Root causes:**
1. **Missing direct dependency:** `vite` was not declared in the chrome-extension package, so it was not installed or linked where the build expected it.
2. **Workspace/hoisting configuration:** In a monorepo with pnpm, dependencies must be explicitly listed in each package that needs them, even if they exist elsewhere in the repo. Hoisting does not guarantee binaries will be available everywhere.
3. **(Earlier) Unnecessary pnpm install scripts:** Some packages tried to install specific pnpm versions during scripts, which is not standard and can cause confusion or errors.

**Summary:**  
The main blocker was the missing direct dependency on `vite` in the relevant package(s). Once this was fixed, the build succeeded.

GratitechHD: One of the problems I keep facing with this extension is the inability to detect if a text field has already been filled out before the AI fills out the same text field with the same data. For example, some job search websites like Indeed may already have the location data filled in, and if the user's prompt also provides the  same location, what ends up happening is the location text field having duplicates (e.g. "Toronto ONToronto ON"). Telling the LLM within the user's prompt to heed such duplication if the text has already been filled is practically ineffective. Such a checking mechanism needs to be hardcoded into the extension itself so that the LLM does not fill out forms that have already been correctly filled.

GitHub Copilot: To solve this problem robustly, you should add a check in your extension’s form-filling logic to detect if a text field already contains the value you intend to fill. If it does, the extension should skip filling that field.

Here’s a practical approach for your extension:

### 1. Check Before Filling
Before setting the value of an input or textarea, compare the current value with the value you want to fill. Only fill if they are different.

### 2. Trim and Normalize
To avoid issues with whitespace or case, trim and normalize both values before comparing.

### 3. Implementation Example
Suppose you have a function that fills fields. You can update it like this:

```javascript
function fillInputField(input, value) {
  const current = (input.value || '').trim();
  const target = (value || '').trim();
  if (current === target) {
    // Already filled correctly, skip
    return;
  }
  input.value = target;
  // Optionally, dispatch input/change events if needed
  input.dispatchEvent(new Event('input', { bubbles: true }));
  input.dispatchEvent(new Event('change', { bubbles: true }));
}
```

### 4. Apply to All Form-Filling Logic
Wherever your extension fills a field, use this check. This prevents duplicate values like "Toronto ONToronto ON".

### 5. Optional: Partial Match
If you want to prevent partial duplication (e.g., "Toronto ONToronto"), you can check if the current value already contains the target value and skip or replace accordingly.

---

**Summary:**  
Add a hardcoded check in your extension’s code to compare the current field value with the intended value before filling. Only fill if they differ. This will prevent duplicate entries and make your extension more robust on sites like Indeed.

The update is complete: your extension will now check if a text field already contains the intended value (ignoring whitespace) before filling it. If the value is already present, it will skip filling that field, preventing duplicate entries like "Toronto ONToronto ON".

You can now test your extension on sites like Indeed to confirm this resolves the duplication issue. If you encounter any further problems or want to refine the logic (e.g., for partial matches), let me know!

GratitechHD: Which files have you changed so far regarding this fix

GitHub Copilot: For the fix to prevent duplicate text field filling, I have changed the following file:

- page.ts

This file was updated to add a check that skips filling a text field if it already contains the intended value. No other files were modified for this specific fix.

GratitechHD: Instigate a big change to the extension by adding the ability to attach files to the prompt for purposes of additional context and augmenting the scope of workable data instead of cramming everything into the prompt text field. Supported files range from simple .txt to documents to json to pdf, etc. Come up with an elegant implementation, both code and visual UI wise. It should support both traditional and drag and drop attachment methods.

GitHub Copilot: To implement file attachment support for augmenting prompts in your extension, here’s a high-level plan:

1. UI: Add a file attachment area to the chat input (with drag-and-drop and traditional file picker support), showing a list of attached files with remove options.
2. Backend: Update the message sending logic to accept files, process them (extract text from .txt, .json, .pdf, etc.), and include their content as context for the LLM.
3. File Handling: Use browser APIs and libraries (like pdf.js for PDFs) to extract text content.
4. UX: Show file previews/names, handle errors (unsupported/too large files), and allow removing attachments before sending.

I’ll start by updating the chat input UI and then add backend support for file processing and context augmentation.

Let’s begin by updating the chat input component to support file attachments. I'll update the ChatInput.tsx component to add a modern, elegant file attachment UI with both drag-and-drop and traditional file picker support, and a preview/removal list. The component will pass the files along with the prompt text to the backend.

After that, I'll outline the backend changes needed to process and extract text from supported files for LLM context.

Let's start with the UI and file handling in the chat input.

Made changes.

Summarized conversation historyYou've already completed the UI/UX and frontend logic for file attachments in ChatInput.tsx, including drag-and-drop, file picker, file preview/removal, and passing files to the backend. The next major steps are:

1. **Backend API & Message Handling**: Update the backend to accept file attachments, extract their content, and augment the LLM context.
2. **File Processing Utilities**: Add utilities for extracting text from `.txt`, `.json`, `.pdf`, etc.
3. **Error Handling & Feedback**: Handle unsupported/oversized files and provide user feedback.
4. **(Optional) Enhanced UX**: Add file type icons/previews.

Here’s a high-level plan and the next concrete steps:

---

### 1. Update Backend API & Types

- Update the backend message handler to accept files (likely as `File`/`Blob` objects or base64).
- Update types/interfaces for messages to include attachments.
- Ensure the backend can receive and process files from the frontend.

### 2. File Processing Utilities

- Add utilities to extract text from:
  - `.txt`/`.json`: Read as text.
  - `.pdf`: Use a library like `pdf-parse` or `pdfjs-dist`.
  - (Optionally) `.docx`, `.csv`, etc.

### 3. Integrate File Processing into Message Pipeline

- When a message is received with files, extract their text content.
- Concatenate or summarize file contents as additional LLM context.
- Handle errors (unsupported type, too large, extraction failure).

### 4. Error Handling & User Feedback

- Return errors to the frontend for unsupported/oversized files.
- Display clear feedback in the UI.

---

I’ll start by searching for the backend message handling logic and types, then proceed to update them to support file attachments.

GitHub Copilot: The backend message handler in index.ts currently processes messages like `new_task` and `follow_up_task` but does not yet handle file attachments. To support file uploads, the following steps are needed:

1. **Extend the message protocol** to accept file attachments (e.g., as an array of files or file metadata + base64).
2. **Update the frontend** (SidePanel.tsx and ChatInput.tsx) to send files as part of the message payload.
3. **Add backend logic** to receive, process, and extract text from supported file types (e.g., `.txt`, `.json`, `.pdf`).
4. **Integrate extracted file content** into the LLM context for task execution.

Next, I will update the backend message handler in index.ts to accept and route file attachments for `new_task` and `follow_up_task`. The frontend currently sends messages for `new_task` and `follow_up_task` as plain objects with `type`, `task`, `taskId`, and `tabId`, but does not yet include file attachments. To support file uploads, we need to:

- Update the frontend to send files (as base64 or ArrayBuffer) in the message payload for `new_task` and `follow_up_task`.
- Update the backend handler in index.ts to accept and process these files.

Next, I will update the backend handler in index.ts to accept an optional `files` array in the message payload for `new_task` and `follow_up_task`. This will prepare the backend for file processing and extraction logic.

GitHub Copilot: The current frontend (ChatInput.tsx and SidePanel.tsx) supports file selection and drag-and-drop, and passes the `files` array to `onSendMessage`. However, the `handleSendMessage` function in SidePanel.tsx only accepts a `text` argument and does not handle files. The backend (index.ts) also does not expect or process files.

**Next steps:**
1. Update `handleSendMessage` in SidePanel.tsx to accept and process files, and send them to the backend as part of the message payload for `new_task` and `follow_up_task`.
2. Update the backend handler in index.ts to accept and prepare for file processing.

I'll start by updating SidePanel.tsx to support sending files to the backend.

The frontend and backend are now connected for file attachment support:

- The frontend (SidePanel.tsx and ChatInput.tsx) sends files as base64-encoded payloads with each message.
- The backend (index.ts) accepts and logs file attachments for `new_task` and `follow_up_task`, ready for further processing.

Next steps are to implement file content extraction and LLM context augmentation, but the file transfer and message protocol are now in place and error-free. Let me know if you'd like to proceed with file content extraction or test the current flow.
